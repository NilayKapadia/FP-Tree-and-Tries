# FP-Tree-and-Tries
This project is an implementation of FP Growth Algorithm in java. This data structure is required for data mining.
This also has the trie folder for the implementation. A sample demo is added in the TrieST class. 
(The trieST class implementation is taken from Algorithms Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne).
